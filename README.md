# OxfordML
The code here is adapted from MLrose which contains various optimisation algorithms, including GAs and simulated annealing. This solves the travelling salesman problem. There are other options for optimisaiotn of both discrete and continuous problems.
For those that prefer straight python I include a .py file of the same thing
pip install mlrose
