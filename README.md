# OxfordML
The code here is adapted from MLrose which contains various optimisation algorithms, including GAs and simulated annealing. This solves the travelling salesman problem. There are other options for optimisation of both discrete and continuous problems.
For those that prefer straight python I include a .py file of the same thing. You need to 
pip install mlrose
